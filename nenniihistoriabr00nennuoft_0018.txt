writer adds 429, as giving the year when he wrote,
bringing us to ΑΛ). 876 (14, 8). Another copy of
considerable antiquity professes to have been writ-
ten in the year 946 or 947; the former of which
dates it states, and that correctly, to be the fifth
year of the reign of King Edmund.¹ Last of all
comes the Paris manuscript, written in the thir-
teenth century, which ascribes the arrival of the
Saxons to A.D. 347, to which it adds 647 years as
indicating the period of its composition, carrying
us onward to A.D. 994. The earlier manuscripts,
therefore, not only do not acknowledge the claims
of Nennius, but assign the composition of the ano-
nymous ‘ Historia Britonum' to dates varying bc-
tween A.D. 796 and 994, the space of two centurieS.

point of literary history is rendered yet more
embarrassing· when we observe that in some in-
stances the work is ascribed, not to Nennius‚ but
to other individuals. When giving a list of the
manuscripts which have been employed in form-
ing this edition, we shall have occasion to show
that many of them erroneously2 profess to contain

tured that Gildas had some claim
to the ‘ Historia Britonum ;’ but,
in the absence of all information
upon this point, it is expedient to
refrain from theorizing.
