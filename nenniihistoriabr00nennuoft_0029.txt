rity3 while the various Readiugs gained t'roin the
collation of numerous manuscripts os ‹lini-rent
ages have been introduced at the hottom 01· the
page. The following manuscripts have been
examined sor the purpose.¹

A. The Hal-leian MS. 3859, (sol. 1⁵35, b,) a Α ηηυῗὲτ s

manuscript of the tenth century, in small solio,
upon vellum, the most important 01· all the
copies which have been consulted sor the pre-
sent edition, and therefore adopted as the basis
of its text. At the bottom of the first page
is a defaced coat of arms, and words which
appear to be, ‘ Conventus Mont-Albanensis,’
but the whole is too far injured by time to be
distinctly seen. Is this reading be correct, it
may be conjectured that the present volume
once formed a portion of the library os the
monastery of Montauban in Quercy, not sar
distant from Toulouse. A note, in the hand-
writing of Casley, states that it was added to
the Harleian Library on 5th January 1729;
beyond which fact nothing is known of its
previous history.

The ‘ Historia Britonum' commences on the
reverse of a leaf, the former page of which is
blank ; and is without title, rubrio, or colophon.
At the top of the first page a more modern,
but still ancient hand, has prefixed a title,
which has unfortunately suffered in the re-
binding of the manuscript. This title appears
to have been ‘ Incipit Computus.’

¹ These manuscripts are cited letters prefixed to the description
in the present edition by the of each.
