xxii arrAcE.

This copy omits all the matter prior to §4
of the present edition, but contains the Genea—
logies, names of Cities, and Miracles, besides
a short Chronicle relative to British affairs, and
some important Welsh genealogical matter un-
connected with the ‘ Historia Britonu1n.'

It is difficult to say whether thc handwriting
is English or Foreig·n; the former seems the
more probable supposition, which is strength-
ened by the accuracy with which the &Velsh
names os places and persons are recorded.

Fac-similes of this, and of some of the other
MSS. which have been used, are given in the
plates which accompany the present edition.

Β. The Cottonian MS. Vespasian, D. xxi.
(fol. 1,) written upon vellum, in small quarto,
about the end of the twelsth, or commence-
ment of the thirteenth century. It is with-
out title or rubrio, either at beginning or end,
and commences with the words ‘ Brittannia
insula a quodam Bruto consule Romano dicta?
(ξ 7.) It contains the GenealogieS, the listros
British CitieS, and the Miracles, but is not di-
vided into Chapters. Its text is good, and
agrees closely with the manuscript A, which it
follow& even when that copy is faulty.

C. The Cottonian MS. Vespasian, B. xxv.
(fol. 126, b‚) written upon vellum, in small
folio, about the middle of the twelfth cen-
tury. At the commencement of the Table of
Contents is the following note, ‘Liber domp-
ni J ohannis Holyngburne monachi ecclesiae
Christi Cantuariae‚ emptus a quodam fratre,
anno 1543 (Ἰ) pretium xxd.’ The same Table
of Contents, written in a contemporaneous
hand, describes the work here printed as ‘ Nar-
ratio de Britonibus, et de miraculis Britanniae3'
