scarches concermng the earlier history and antiquities of ι rthcrn Europe and America in two simulta-
ιιι-(ηις periodmal work-S, to be entitled Axxlm and ΜΕΜοῐκε ; by which means they, no longer bounding
thep- vlews hy the lumts of 'Non-thern Europe, hope to render the most important of their reseawhes more
easily acceseible totthe public at lai-ge. In the ANNA ns.. contributions of the above-mentioned nature will
he recelved m Danleh ⁰.¹' Swedish (and occasionally in Icelandic); and, wherever it may appear desireable
sor the sake of elucxdanon οι· infonnation, Maps will be given, and also Delinvations of Antiqztz'tieS, and
of the Illonnmaevzls'of t'he· ancient times. The Mnmoms, which are inseparably connected with the
Annals, wssl compi-ise sumlar contributions in Enylssh, Freneh, οι· German, either original or translated.

tamed ιι] the Annals, and orlglnaJ contributions not elsewhere communicated in the works of the society.
111 Enybsh, sor example, there will be successively inserted the result 01¹ the continued investigations and
researches of the Society's Commatees οη the Historical Monuments of Greenland, and on the Ante-
C'olnmlgmn sttory of Amor-ica, in order to throw as much light as poseible on the ancient accounts con-
tamed m the two works above announoed.

, Os the Annals it is expected that one Number in 8vo.‚ containing from 10 to 15 sheets, will be pub-
lishedyearly, commencmg from 1836 ; and that a Number os similar size will be published of the

Number os the Memmrs w111 appear in 1838. In each sem‘es two Numbers will always make a volume.
The pnce of each Number is 58„ consequently os each volume los.
