the discovery of truth; and it is not impossible
that a more careful investigation of the question
might tend satisfactorily to establish what now
rests upon only strong circumstantial evidence.¹

§1st Passing from the literary history of the

the‘Historia work, (which, in compliance with long-estab-

Britonum.·

lished usage, we continue to call NenniuS,) a
very few remarks upon its intrinsic value, as a
document illustrating the Annals of the British
nation, may be suleoined. It will be found upon
examination that this must be cautiously esti-
mated, and that too high an opinion of it has
generally been formed. But it is not without
its value. Its chief importance seems to consist
in it being, not an historic record of events with
which the writer was either personally acquaint-

investigation will not fail to re-'

mark that the only MS. which,

contains the two Prologues‚ (for 4

the Glasgow copy is, apparently,
a modern transcript from it,) iS, in
all probability, of Durham origin 3
so at least we may infer from the
local character of many pieces
which it contains. We find in it
copies of ‘Symeon‚ de Ecclesia
Dnnelmensi,' ‘De Ranulfo epis-
copo [Dunelmensi,] tempore Gu-

S. Cuthbert0,’ (the patron saint
of the Chur(·hofDurham,) ‘ Ethel-

nensibus,' (a cell of Durham, as
it is well 1010an and ⁶ Ricardus

point of antiquity is that yet
preserved at Durham, where it
was transcribed in the thirteenth
century ; and another marked G.
in our list, which was written
at the Priory of Fenchale, in the
immediate vicinity of that city.
May not we hence infer that
these Prologues have a northern
origin?

the ‘Capitula Gildae,' Cap. XL,

employed himself upon these,

Prologues.
