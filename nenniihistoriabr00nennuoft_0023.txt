close manner in which his nanie is identified
with at least a emnponent. part ol' the present
work, through the undisputed authority os llcric,
is enough to prevent us from secking elsewhere
for the author ot' that portion.

ξ 14. The statements already advanced‚ how-
ever contradictory and unintelligible when view-
ed in connexion with the tale told by the Pro-
logues, seem clearly to establish the following
positions.

1. That the ‘ Historia Britonum’ is the pro·
duction of an unknown writer.

2. That it is ascribed to Nennius upon the sole
authority os Prologues which cannot be traeed
to an earlier period than the twelsth century,
before which period the name osNennius, as an
historiam was probably unknown.

3. That the variations in the different manu-
scripts are of such a nature as to show that the
work has undergone several recensions‚ in conse-
quence of which its original form or extent can-
not now be satisfactorily ascertained.

§ 15. Before leaving this branch of the in-
quiry, a few concluding remarks may be neces-
sary. It may, perhaps, be expected that the
Editor, having ventured to express his doubt
as to the authenticity os these Prologues‚ should
be prepared to show when, where, and by whom
they were written. In confessing his inability
to do so, he would add, that, from the very na-
ture os things, such a discovery is scarcely to
be demanded, sor the writer of spurious Pro-
logues would cautiously suppl-ess all insormation
tending to show them to be i'orgeries. But the
removal os error is often the first step towards

nesuns of
the inquiry.
