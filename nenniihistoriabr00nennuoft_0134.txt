BY THE REV. WILLIAM DANSEY, AM.

RECTOR OF DONHEAD ST. ANDREW, {Kurssl {Bam OF οΗΑιΚΕ, Ψιιτε.

This most important work on the Church should find a'place on the shelves of every clergymau of the
Establishment. The History qftlze Rise and From-ess ο] 1]ιο Ι)α1“οι·1ιίιιῖ (Ἰωχφῃ, alone, fills space enough
to have formed a small separate volume, and 01· the great important-e of this section 01· Mr.'Dansey's
labours, there can be but one opinion. Arehdeacon Goddard, in his recent charge, strongly recommends
this work, as “ almundz'ny in solid Ecclesiastical and AntiqnnJ-ima viewss' aud the reviewers in the
elaborate notice of the book in the Quarterly Tleeoloyz'cal and in the British DIayazine, pass the highest
eulogium upon the talented author, whom they compare to the eminent divines of former days. To place
his labours within the reach of all his brethren‚ Mr. Dansey has liberally caused the volumes to be charged

only at the eost ofthe paper and print.

THE BREEDER’S GUIDE;

In its improved state, the CouRsmz's COMPANmN, it is hoped, will find a place in the library of every
amateur οἵ the Leash, containing, as it now does, every point of insmmation connected with the most,
classical of field-sports. The Code 01· Laws laid down in the former edition having been adopted by the
principal clubs in this country and IreIand, has rendered the work ol' the utmost importance to the
coursing publio: whilst the Toeatise οι) Breeding makes it the indispensahle Manual in the Kennel. To
the man os tame, the book, from the simplicity os its style, possessas many charms, enlivened as itis by
copious anecdote and illustration.
