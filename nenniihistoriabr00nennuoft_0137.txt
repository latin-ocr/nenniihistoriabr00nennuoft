nlusuatious possess. Tbey are as unique iu then· way as the> book they adom—“In point os ex-
terior embellishment, no former edition os this enchanting work can compete with that issued by
Mffisrs. eaden aud Dan-ies in 1820, with :22 line engravings, by Heath, from drawings by Stothard.
With these the type and paper are in good keeping, and altogether exhibit Crusoe iu his gayest
clothing.‘·-w11.sox·s Lura 01¹ DE roz.
