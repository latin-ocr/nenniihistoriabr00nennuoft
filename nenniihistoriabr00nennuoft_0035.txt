L 2. A second copy of Nennius, contained
in the manuscript last described. It omits the
Prologues‚ and the chapter about Ida king of
Northumbria, and has the title, ‘ Gesta Brit—
tonum a Gilda Sapiente c01nposita.' It states
that 796 years had elapsed from the period of
our Lord's passion.

Ill. A manuscript of the seventeenth cen-
tury, formerly belonging to Dr. Hunter the
celebrated anatomist, and now, along with the
rest os his collectionS, the property of the Uni-
versity of Glasgow. It appears to be a tran-
script os the Cambridge manuscript marked L,
containing, like it, the two Prologues, and the
interpolated passageS.² It must be admitted,
however, that it surnishes a reading in the
second Prologue which is peculiar to itself‚
and thus restores sense to a passage which is
unintelligible in all other copieS.3
