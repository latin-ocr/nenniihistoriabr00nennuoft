xx PREFACE.
as if for publication, no edition appeared until the
year 1691, when Gale inserted it in his Collection
01 the early English 111510113115.1 111 115 prepara-
tion he adopted as the basis 011115 text the manu-
script belonging to the Public Library of Cam-
bridge, which has so frequently been mentioned
as containing both the Prologues, as well as much
interpolated matter. We are not inforlned 01 1116
reasons which induced him to give the preference
to this copy, when he had access to others of
greater antiquity 3 we may therefore presume
that he adopted it as containing additional mat-
ter which he did not find elsewhere. The notes
which 116 appended contain the Various Readings
which he obtained from other manuscripts, chiefly
those in the Cottonian Library.

§2st In the present edition a plan somewhat
different has been followed.2 Instead 01 taking
sor the groundwork of its text that copy which

ther, of interpolated passageS, that text has been
adopted which ishleast vitiated by such extra-
neous matter.3 The errors into which its 11311-

2 In justification 01 1115 departure
from the precedent surnished by
Gale‚the Editor quotes the higher
authority of Usher, who in a letter
to Camden expresses himself in
these 1611115.
Ν1111115 it were not amiss, that
whatsoever is there more than in
Gildas‚ should be printed in adis-
tinct character from the rest3 for
so both works, (if we may count
them to be 111-0,) should be repre-
sented unto us, and the glosses

often distinguished from the text, t

as in the Bennet copy.’-—Parr's
Life 01 Archbishop Usher, p. 77.
It appears that when Usher

‘ In setting out of

wrote this letter he was partly
misled by the rubrics 01 111056
manuscripts which ascribe the
‘Historia Britonum’ to (indas,
and here expresses himself as if
the later interpolations had been
added by Nennius to what he
considered the genuine work 01
Gildas. Yet even then heis cau-
tious in his assertions, and a more
careful examination of the sub-
*ject convinced him that Gildas
was unconnected with this pro-
duction in any 01 115 varied forms.

3 This MS. is 01 the tenth cen-
¹tur53 that which Gale followed
*is of the end of the twelfth, or
, beginning of the thirteenth.
