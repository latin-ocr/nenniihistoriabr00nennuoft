ignorant of the existence of a writer of that
name. He appearS‚ indeed, to have entertained
considerable doubt as to who the author really
was, although he upon one occasion falls into
the common error os his age in attributing the
work to Gildas. Introducing the story osTur-
nus and his son Brutus, he informs his readers
that lie did not find it in Beda, but in ‘ other au-
thors,'¹ and then proceeds with the narrative
nearly in the words os Nennius.2 Observing an
omission upon the part of Beda as to the period
when this island was first peopled, he supplies
that information from ‘a certain autho1·,’ and
then introduces a long passage copied from the
present work.3 An account of the twelve battles
gained by Arthur are inserted in the exact words
of Nennius, and yet, upon this occasion, ‘ Gildas
Historiographus' is the authority cited ;4 as if the
Archdeacon of Huntingdon had resolved‚ before
terminating his history of the British monarchy,
to show how vague was the information regard- '
ing it which had descended to the age in which
he lived. It appears from these passages that
