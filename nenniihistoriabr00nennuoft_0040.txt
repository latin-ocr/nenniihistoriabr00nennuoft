xxxii PREFACE.

Editor has not observed elsewhere. They may
perhaps have been derived from one of the

Cottonian manuscripts which was burnt in the
fire os 1731.

Tse nqtgsor §23 Upon these authorities the text of the

‘'nmmum‘' present edition has been formed. Since it be-
came necessary to exhibit such a body of Various
Readings, the Editor considered it incumbent
upon him to refrain as much as possible from
increasing the supplemental matter by intro-
ducing many Notes. Various obscure passages
are therefore passed over in silence3 many illus-
trative observations have been omitted; and the
few which are given are intended, for the most
part, to direct the attention of the reader to those
historians who may be consulted with advantage
upon the subject under consideration.
