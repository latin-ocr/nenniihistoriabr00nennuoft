logne which ascribes the composition os the ⁸ llis-

to the infin-ination respecting the author snr-
nisbed by the manuscripts which we are about to
consider.

ᾗ S. The next observation which presents itsels'rng earnm
is, that the greater number os the manuscripts, igffiibssh'nni'ss
indeed all anterior to the twell'th century, ³⁰⁰¹¹¹⁰⁵²
contain neither os the Prolognes which have
been mentioned, and, consequent1y‚ that there is
no internal evidence upon which they are to be
ascribed to Nennius. These anonymous copies
begin with some chronological details, which are
intended to show the number of years which
have elapsed between certain great events. We
are there informed that, when the work was
written, 796 years had elapsed from the passion of
our Savionr (6, 2) 3 a date which varies in various
copies, some making the number 800, others 879.
Another class of manuscripts joins the year 796
with the thirtieth year of the reign of Anaraught,
king of North wales, the accuraey of which we
have no means of testing ; but immediately after-
wards it throws discredit upon the statement, by
conjoining this date with the year of the world
6108, which, according tobis own showing (6, 1),
carries us on to ΛΑ). 980.

ξ 9. Further chronological particulars are else· The dates

vary so as to

birth of our Saviour until the arrival of St.age οἰκω-
Patrick amongst the Seots,405 years bad elapsed, '¹¹⁰⁵'

and that 4:21 years had passed since that event,

a calculation which is equivalent to ΑΛ). 826.

This date varies materially in the different manu-

scripts which have been co‘nsnlted (ς’ 16, note).
