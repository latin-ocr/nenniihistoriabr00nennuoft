xxviii PREFACE.

N. A manuscript of the thirteenth century,
upon vellum, in solio, now belonging to the
library of the Dean and Chapter of Durham,¹
(B. ii. 35,) where it has remained since the
period when it was written. It commences
with the second os the two Prologues, to which
it prefixes the title, ‘ Incipit Eulogium brevis-
simum Britanniae insulae, quod Nennius, El-
vodugi discipulus, congregavit? Between the
‘Eulogium' and the work itself a marginal
note stands thus, ‘Res gesta a Nennio Sa-
piente composita, de aetatibus mundi 3' but
the title which has been adopted is the follow-
ing, ‘ Gesta Britonum a Gilda Sapiente com-
posita.' Its margins contain numerous ad-
ditions, agreeing closely with G. and K 3 these
appear to have been added in the year 1166, a
note in the same handwriting (at p. 249) re-
ferring to that date.

It agrees accurately with the manuscripts
severally marked G. and K, see p. 8, note 20;
13, note ‘¹ ; 17, note ¹⁶ ; 19, note ⁷ 3 27, note ¹⁵3
28, note ¹5 3 29, note ¹⁸.

O. A manuscript in the Bibliotheque du Roi,
at Paris, (Supplement Latin, 165, l⁶) in folio,
written upon vellum, in the twelfth century.
It is without either title or Prologue, com-
mences with the words, ‘Britannia insula a
quodam Bruto consule Romano.’ It varies
from most of the other copies by inserting near
its commencement a list of the British Cities,
and professes to have been written 647 years

¹ The Editor avails himself of ter of Durham, sor the important
this opportunity of offering his advantages which the present
thanks to the Rev. James Raine, edition has derived from the ma-
Librarian to the Dean and Chap- nuscript here described.
