PREFACE. xiii

.
Henry 01· lluntingdon, although acquainted nith
the ‘ Historia Britonum,’¹ attached no great
weight to its autho1·ity,² and cited it either as nn
anonymous work, or attributed its composition
to Gildas.³

ξ 12. Nor is Gildas the only author whose
elaims to the present work require notice. It is
an important fact, that one os the earliest manu-
scripts, is not the very earliest, extant, ascribes
it neither to Nennius nor to Gildas, but to one
whom it styles Mark the Hel-mit. This indi-
vidual, unknown to our bibliographers and his-
torians, ancient as well as modern, is, in this
copy, simply called ‘ Marcus the Anachorite, a
bishop of the British nati0n,'⁴‘ and no further in-
formation respecting him is afforded by its pageS.
No‘W, since this manuscript twice refers to the
year 946 or 947,5 (and is these passages be not in-
terpolated,) it will follow, beyond all doubt, that
Mark the Hermit must have been alive in those
years.

ἓ 13. There appears to be evidence to show,
however, either that these passages have been

added at a later period, οι· that the claims of

Mark to the authorship of the ‘ Historia Britonum'
are without foundation. Constantius Hericus, an
