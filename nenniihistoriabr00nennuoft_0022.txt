xiv PREFACE.

author os considerable reputation, wrote an ac-
count of the Life and Miracles of St. Germanus,
which he dedicated to the Emperor Charles the
Bald, in A.D. 876, or, at latest, in 877.ι He there
cites, as his authority for several miracles wrought
by Germanus, the testimony of ‘ a certain holy old
man named Mark, a bishop of the British nation‚
and a native of that island 3² concerning whom
he gives further particulars, mentioned in the
subjoined note.³ Nor should we fail to remark
that this Heric quoteS, as srom the dictation of
M ark, the adventures of Germanus and the Cow-
herd, which find a place in the ‘ Historia Bri-

101111111.”ί

Julii, tom. vii. p. 192, ξ 40, 41,

is established.

compare the present work, ξ 32,

narrative in Herio.

 

That Mark the Hermit, who was an

The Annales Benedictini‚ xxxu.
xliv. and the Acta SS. Ord. S.
Bened. sec. 1v. p. ii. p.470, may
also be consulted for further in-
formation concerning Mark, un-
connected, however, with the
present inquiry.

If the Editor may be permitted
to theorize upon such an obscure
point, he would venture to a'c-
count for the title of the Vatican
MS. by assuming that some one
acquainted with the work of
Herio had met with an anony-
mous copy of the ⁶ Historia Bri-
tonum‚' which he ventured to as-
cribe to Mark the Hermit, since
he found it recording those mira-
cles of Germanus which Heric
had derived from Mark's testi-
mony3 instead of which conclu-
sion, it seems more probable that
the Legends incorporated in the
‘ Historia Britonum' were de-
rived either from Heric's narra-
tive, or from the ‘litterae catho-
licae,' preserved in his time in
Britain, to which Mark referred
when narrating the story to He-
ric. See the Acta SS. above
quoted, ξ 82.
