have the appearance of genuine British traditions
of considerable antiquity. Vortigern’s incest
with his daughter introduces a second notice of
Germanus, not derived from Mark the Ilermit,¹
and a further extract from a similar narrative ter-
minates the history of that monarch. The Legend
of Patrick then follow& although entirely uncon-
nected with the context 3² and the whole con-
cludes with an account of the exploits of Arthur,
and the twelve battles in which he routed the
Saxons.³ The genealogies of the Saxon mon-
archs, and the Treatise ‘ de mirabilibus Bri-
tanniae,' formed, as we may believe, no part os
the original work ; but being os remote antiquity‚
and found in the greater numberof the manuscripts,

the poems and tales of that na-

latitude in numbers is easily ac-
counted for, it may be enough to
state that even the Laws of that
nation are not exempt from the
infiuence of Triads, the Index to
W'oton’s Leges Wauieae pointing
out at least three hundred in-
stances.
