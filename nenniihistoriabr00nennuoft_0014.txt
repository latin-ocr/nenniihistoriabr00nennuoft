agrees, sor the most part, with that which we
have already mentioned, omitting, however, the
date when the work was written. Hence, then,
it appears that there is the authority os only one
ancient manuscript sor asserting that Nennius‚
assuming him to be the author, composcd his work
in the year 8583 and that it is ascribed to him
upon the saith of Prologues, of which no copies
are to be found anterior to the twelfth century.
TheProlqgue ξ 3. In regard to the ProIogue, it may further
ssfflifflcx-OEk be remarked that it speaks of the year 858 as
‘my' being the same with the twenty-fourth year of
the reign of Mervin, king of the Britons (3, 17),
dates in the accuracy of whose concurrence a con-
temporary writer could with difficulty commit an
error. In the body of the work, however, we
find a contradictory statement. It is there as-
sumed that the Saxons arrived in England A.D.
447 (24, 17), to which are added 429 years, and
the two dates added together are said to form a
synchronism with the fourth year of Mervin (14,
8), which is here therefore stated to be the year
876. Thus, the Prologue and the text vary no
less than thirty-eight years in the year of our
Lord which they connect with the regnal year of
the sovereign who was upon the throne when the
whole is said to have been written3 and they
mol-cover show, that, if both be genuine, the body
of the work must have been written twenty years
before the Prologue.
