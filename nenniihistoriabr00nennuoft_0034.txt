L. A manuscript of the end of the twelsth,
or beginning of the thirteenth century, now in
the Public Library of the University of Cam-
bridge, marked F. f. i. 27. Itis a handsome vo-
lume, written in double columns, upon vellum,
appears once to have belonged to the monks of
Durham, (see this Introduction, ᾗ 15, note ¹,)
and is the only ancient copy which contains
both Prologues. It formed, as has already
been remarked, the basis of Gale’s text3 and
is the only copy which prefixes to the history
a series os Capitula, which contain internal
evidence either of forgery or interpolation.
These have in this edition been thrown into
an Appendix. This manuscript also contains
the following verses, which may perhaps be
worth preserving, as well as two extracts
from some short chronological memoranda.

gistri sui, Beulani presbyteri, viri religi-
osi, ad quem Historiam istam scripserat.

¹ It will be observed that each order, excepting the letters X,
word of these verses commences Y, and Z, which commence
with a letter in alphabetical lines.
