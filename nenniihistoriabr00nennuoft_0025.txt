the arrixal os the Picts and Scots, and of the
Scythian nobleman who had resided in Egypt,
without feeling that it here represents what may
almost be called the mythology osa people igno-
rant of its true origin, and uncertain to what
theory the preference should be given. The
account of the Roman period of our history is
obscure and confused, made up, apparently, os
two distinct narratives, injudiciously blended
together,² at the conclusion of which the na-
tional prejudices of the writer are pe1·ceptible.³
The history of the reign ofVortigern is inter-
rupted to introduce a long account of the mi-
racles of Germanus? which, upon a comparison of
the passages by which it is immediately preceded
and followed, seems to have formed no part of
the original work. The arrival os the Saxons,
the manner in which they gained a footing in
this island, the marriage of Vortigern with the
daughter os Hengist,⁵ and the sui-render of Kent,

remarks so far exceeded the ex-
tent which was anticipatod, it
was the Editor's intention to

account which he gives of the
arrival of the Scoti in Ireland is
the same as that found in the
Psaltair-na-rann of [Engus Coli-
daeus preserved in the Rawlinson
MS. 502; see O’Connor, Rer.
